              Platform users can invite others to join as consultants using an invitation code. Once they join, they become part of your downline.
              <br /><br />
              As an upline, you will receive a 5% commission from the earnings of your Senior Consultants in your downline.
              <br /><br />
              The commissions earned by the upline are automatically credited to their platform account and can be tracked in the Team Report.
              <br /><br />
              All consultants and downlines enjoy the same commission structure and rewards. Building a team does not affect your personal commissions or individual earnings.
